- 👋 Hi, I’m @tgoodner
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code starting with front-end, but I am super excited about back-end functionality!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML5, CSS, Javascript.  I'm working through The Odin Project and looking forward to seeing how I develop my skills over time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will both provide me opportunities to learn, and contribute to other developers.
- 📫 How to reach me at tgoodner@gmail.com
